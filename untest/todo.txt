update test suite
x cleanup API and fix state bug (using require the state is conserved between tests runs)
x fix readme image
x exit codes
x implement TAP reporter https://testanything.org/. Not relevant in the OC context
x traceback display if needed
x do I need the trace outside of the coroutine? (see comment)
x timeout option
x implement OpenPrograms
x what happens when overflow max color depth? (it displays all the colors)
x functions that have multiples returns
x recursive `describe()`. Nop, to much hassle! https://medium.com/better-programming/yagni-you-aint-gonna-need-it-f9a178cd8e1
x limit depth to 8 to avoid stack overflow errors and misusage (see task above)
x document API using ldoc
x pass stack (numbers) arguments to functions
x pass heap (objects, functions) arguments to functions
x before, after, beforeEach and afterEach support
x mock api for cross-platform testing. Nop, just test in OpenComputers, don'treimplement the reimplementation :)
